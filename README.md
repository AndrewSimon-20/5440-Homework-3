## Constructing the stoichiometric matrix S for the urea cycle:
I used looked at the [Arginine biosynthesis in humans](https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?org_name=hsa&mapno=00220&mapscale=&show_description=hide) to retrieve the reactants and products of the 6 one way reactions taking place in our Urea cycle. I stored this data on the "stoic and atomic arrays" page of [this](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Homework-3/blob/master/Stoic%20and%20Atomic%20Arrays%20with%20labels.xlsx) Excel file. V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V-5, correspond to 6.3.4.5, 4.3.2.1, 3.5.3.1, 2.1.33, 1.14.13.39 forward, and 1.14.13.39 reverse in the urea cycle respectively. I completed the stoichiometric matrix by adding flux columns, b1-15, to account for species that had to be "imported" or "exported" from our imaginary boundary. 


## Balancing the stoiciometric matrix S:
I again used the [Arginine biosynthesis in humans](https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?org_name=hsa&mapno=00220&mapscale=&show_description=hide) to retrieve the molecular structures for each of the reactants and products in the cycle. I then created an atomic matrix, A, with this data that I stored in the "stoic and atomic arrays" page of [this](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Homework-3/blob/master/Stoic%20and%20Atomic%20Arrays%20with%20labels.xlsx) Excel file. I then created two separate CSV files of the [atomic matrix](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Homework-3/blob/master/Atomic%20Array.csv) and the [stoiciometric matrix](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Homework-3/blob/master/Stoic%20Array.csv) to be able to import them into Julia. I then created [this](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Homework-3/blob/master/AndrewSimonHomework3) Julia script to check if the stoiciometric matrix was balanced by creating the new matrix E = A'S. I added a loop to check if the 6 reactions were balanced and to print the reaction rows if they were not. At first there were a few rows unbalanced, but this was because I entered a couple of the chemical formulas in incorrectly. Otherwise the stoiciometric array would have already been balanced.


## Calculating the maximum rate of urea production:
Creating the upper and lower bounds for the flux I set all of the bj to a range of [0,10 mmol/gDW-hr] as specified in the problem statement. Because I broke my reactions into two one way reactions I set the lower bound of each v to equal zero. For the maximum for each v I converted the Kcat values given to hours and the E value given to mm/gDW then v,i,max, = EKcat,i . I saved this data in the "Flux Lower and Upper Bounds" page of [this](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Homework-3/blob/master/Stoic%20and%20Atomic%20Arrays%20with%20labels.xlsx) Excel file as well as a [Flux Upper and Lower Bounds](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Homework-3/blob/master/Flux%20Upper%20and%20Lower%20Bounds.csv) CSV file. Because the system is in steady state I set all of the species upper and lower bounds to zero and stored it in the "Species Lower and Upper Boundsd" of [this](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Homework-3/blob/master/Stoic%20and%20Atomic%20Arrays%20with%20labels.xlsx) Excel file as well as a [Species Upper and Lower Bounds](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Homework-3/blob/master/Species%20Upper%20and%20Lower%20Bounds.csv) CSV file. Finally, I imported the CSV files into Julia and set the objective function array to be all zeros except for urea which I set to -1 (because I set the minflag to true). This work is also found in [this](https://github.com/AndrewSimon-20/5440-Homework-3/blob/master/AndrewSimonHomework3) Julia script. It prints the output of the solver. __My answer was:__ -1.242 mmol/gDW-hr or 1.242 mmol/gDW-hr depending on your reference frame. 


(admitedly I should have made a separate script for part C, but I was lazy and didn't want to wait for the csv files to import again)
